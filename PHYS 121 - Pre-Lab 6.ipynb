    "First, notice that $f(x)$ is steep for small values of $x$ and shallow for larger values of $x$. This observation will turn out to be important when considering how to estimate uncertainties in $z$ from known uncertainities in $x$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose that you have made a measurement of $x$ and obtained the result $x_\\mathrm{A}\\pm\\delta x_\\mathrm{A}$.  For example, perhaps $x$ represents the position of a particle in a particle accelerator and $z = f(x)$ is its speed.  **Figure 1** shows the position of $x_\\mathrm{A}$ along the $x$-axis and the range of $x$ values spanning $x_\\mathrm{A} - \\delta x_\\mathrm{A} < x < x_\\mathrm{A} + \\delta x_\\mathrm{A}$.  Our objective is to find the corresponding range of $z$ values spanned along the vertical axis and to use this range to estimate $\\delta z_\\mathrm{A}$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The strategy is to assume that $f(x)$ can be reasonably well approximated as a straight line over the range of $x$ values from $x_\\mathrm{A} - \\delta x_\\mathrm{A}$ to $x_\\mathrm{A} + \\delta x_\\mathrm{A}$.  This assumption will be valid provided $\\delta x_\\mathrm{A}$ is small.  Fortunately, we already know how to find a straght line that approximates $f(x)$.  Recall that the first derivative of $f(x)$ with respect to $x$ gives the slope of a line that is tangent to $f(x)$.  Therefore, at $x=x_\\mathrm{A}$, the required slope is given by  $\\left.\\dfrac{df}{dx}\\right\\vert_{x_\\mathrm{A}}$. Next, recall that we can also find the slope of a straight line using $\\mathrm{rise}/\\mathrm{run}$.  Referring again to **Fig. 1**, the dashed green line centred on $(x, z) = (x_\\mathrm{A}, f(x_\\mathrm{A}))$ is tangent to $f(x)$ and has $\\mathrm{rise} = -\\delta z_\\mathrm{A}$ and $\\mathrm{run} = \\delta x_\\mathrm{A}$.  Equating these two methods for finding the slope of the tangent gives:\n",
