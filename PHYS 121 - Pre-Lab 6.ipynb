Next, recall that we can also find the slope of a straight line using $\\mathrm{rise}/\\mathrm{run}$.  Referring again to **Fig. 1**, the dashed green line centred on $(x, z) = (x_\\mathrm{A}, f(x_\\mathrm{A}))$ is tangent to $f(x)$ and has $\\mathrm{rise} = -\\delta z_\\mathrm{A}$ and $\\mathrm{run} = \\delta x_\\mathrm{A}$.
